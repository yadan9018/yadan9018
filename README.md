👋 Hi there! I’m Yasmin Abdi, a passionate tech enthusiast from Kenya currently living in Sweden. With a background in Computer Technology and hands-on experience as an ICT Officer, I have developed a strong interest in project management, UX design, and AI.

🎓 I recently enrolled in the Google Project Management Certificate program to enhance my skills in organizing projects and collaborating with diverse teams. I believe effective project management is key to bringing innovative ideas to life, and I'm excited to learn practical tools and methodologies to implement in my future endeavors.

💡 On GitHub, I aim to share my projects related to technology, UX design, and any personal endeavors I undertake. I’m always eager to learn and connect with fellow developers and project managers, so feel free to reach out!

🌍 In my free time, I enjoy exploring the latest technology trends and contributing to open-source projects. Let's collaborate and make great things happen!
